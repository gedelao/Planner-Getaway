        Planner-Getaway allows users to create their own list of places that they'd like to visit.
        By searching any city through googles' map api, you'll be prompted to a new page with whichever location
        was picked. In addition, users will be able to see the 5 day forecast in real time and a new search bar. Unlike the previous
        searchbar, here, users can search for any malls, stores, park, etc. and have it shown in the results. Once a spot has been chosen,
        you can add it to your itinerary list and save it for later. Changed your mind about a specific spot, don't worry, you can always 
        remove it from you list.
