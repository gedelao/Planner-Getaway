# Planner-Getaway

Planner-Getaway allows users to create their own list of places that they'd like to visit.
By searching any city through googles' map api, you'll be prompted to a new page with whichever location
was picked. In addition, users will be able to see the 5 day forecast in real time and a new search bar. Unlike the previous
searchbar, here, users can search for any malls, stores, park, etc. and have it shown in the results. Once a spot has been chosen,
you can add it to your itinerary list and save it for later. Changed your mind about a specific spot, don't worry, you can always 
remove it from you list.
